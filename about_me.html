						<p>Originally from Texas I am now in New Jersey as a Ph.D. Candidate at Rutgers University in 
						the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Growing up I played clarinet and wanted to go into music 
						education. It was not until college that my love of science was rekindled and I realized I 
						wanted to pursue a career in astrophysics.</p>
						<p>After high school I went to college at Texas A&M University (Gig 'em, Aggies!) where I obtained my 
						Bachelor of Science in Physics. I was able to participate in reserch opporitunities at my own institution
						and at Northwestern University through an REU program. I originally began research in high redshift photometry 
						but shifted to working with cosmological simulations about half way through college. I now continue work
						in theoretical astrophysics by analyzing the Lyman-alpha forest and feedback models in cosmological 
						galaxy formation simulations.</p>

						<p>Apart from my research, I enjoy learning new hobbies, playing video games, and taking care of my
						two pet rabbits. My rabbits names are Vladimir and Carmilla, they have been happily bonded for nearly a year,
						and their favorite treat is banana.</p>
